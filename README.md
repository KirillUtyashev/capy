## **Inspiration**  
We all have younger siblings who spend hours on short-form content like Reels and TikTok. That inspired us to create a game where learning happens *while* playing—an engaging way to make education fun!

- 🎮 **Roguelike combat** – Play as a knight and battle different monsters.  
- 🧠 **AI-powered quiz system** – Answer dynamically generated questions based on topics you choose.  
- 🧚 **Companion fairy** – Get hints and explanations when you struggle.  
- ❤️ **Healing items** – Restore HP by collecting potions.  
- 🌍 **Multiple terrains** – Explore different environments as you progress.  
- 🔁 **Infinite gameplay** – Keep going as long as you survive!
